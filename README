Version 2.3.3

The PHP Validation script is a set of validation rules which lets you add server-side validation to your forms quickly and with as little effort as possible. I wrote it to work as the server-side version of my RSV validation library; both employ exactly the same logic and validation rules, so you can simply copy and paste the validation rules from one to the other - which really cuts down on dev time.
